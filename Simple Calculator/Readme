A simple C++ program that allows the user to input two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to perform

This program first prompts the user to enter two numbers and then asks for the desired arithmetic operation. It uses a switch statement to perform the selected operation and handles division by zero as an error case. The result is then displayed to the user.

You can compile and run this code in a C++ development environment to perform basic arithmetic operations.
